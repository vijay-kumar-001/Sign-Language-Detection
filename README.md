This project utilizes Python along with Google Teachable Machine to develop a real-time sign language detection system.

Utilizing OpenCV for computer vision tasks, the program captures and preprocesses hand gestures from live video feeds. 

Through the integration of Google Teachable Machine's machine learning models, the system effectively classifies these gestures into corresponding sign language symbols or text representations.
