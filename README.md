# Sign Language Detection System

This project utilizes Python along with Google Teachable Machine to develop a real-time sign language detection system.

The system captures and preprocesses hand gestures from live video feeds using OpenCV and classifies these gestures into corresponding sign language symbols or text representations through the integration of Google Teachable Machine's machine learning models.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection using live video feed.
- Preprocessing of captured gestures for accurate classification.
- Integration with Google Teachable Machine for gesture classification.
- Translation of gestures into sign language symbols or text.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The main programming language used for the project.
- OpenCV: Used for computer vision tasks to capture and preprocess hand gestures from live video feeds.
- Google Teachable Machine: Utilized for creating and integrating machine learning models for gesture classification.
